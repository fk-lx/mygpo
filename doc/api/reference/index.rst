API Reference
=============

This is the reference documentation for the gpodder.net API 3.

The API can be accessed via http and https. https is preferable from a security
/ privacy point of view and should be used by all clients. gpodder.net also
seems to be blocked in China via plain http.

All endpoints are offered at https://api.gpodder.net/3/.

The :ref:`integration-guide` contains additional non-normative information for
integrating gpodder.net into podcasting applications.
